## Shawn Dominguez Development

Born and raised in Rockport Texas, but currently living in San Marcos Texas. I am a Computer Information Systems major at Texas State University with an anticipated graduation date of December 2019. I am thoroughly interested in database management and implementation, as well as software and web development. Through my courses at Texas State I have a fundamental understanding of SQL database management, C# object oriented programming, and system analysis. Apart from that I am currently teaching myself Python programming through an outside web resource.
