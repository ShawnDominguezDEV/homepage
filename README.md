## About Me

![linkedinpic](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43920487/46579264-8ca97b80-c9d3-11e8-9960-f32e771fe62d.jpg)

Born and raised in Rockport Texas and currently living in Austin Texas. As a graduate of Texas State University with a BBA in Computer Information Systems, I am thoroughly interested in database management, as well as software and application development. Through my courses at Texas State I have a fundamental understanding of SQL database management, object oriented programming, system analysis, and web development. Apart from my studies at the university, I am currently teaching myself Python programming through an outside resource.

In my spare time, I enjoy spending time in the fresh air whether at a local park or live music event. My music interests vary widely from classic rock to hip-hop/rap. I also have a cat, Ruca, who is about 3 years old that I enjoy my nights at home with.

## Employment Opportunities

My most recent place of employment was at Insight where I served as an Inside Sales Account Executive. In this role I ensured our clients had ample access and ease when it come to the procurement of their IT needs. As a hardware and software reseller with over 5000 partners, I was required to know general information on a plethora of products from leading OEM's. While at Insight I was not only tasked with handling current customers, but bringing in new business with over $150k of new business brought in within my time of employment. Althought I exceled at sales, I want to take these interpersonal and technical skills and begin applying them closer to my field of study. I am currently in the market for entry positions into the IT field to broaden my experience. Some of the roles I have been actively looking into and applying for are related to Help Desk or Quality Assurance, but I have an open mind when it comes to new employment.

As someone actively looking for a new career, I would love any opportuntiy to engage with recruiters. Please feel free to reach out to me through my e-mail or LinkedIn which are both listed in the following paragraph.

Apart from that you can feel free to <a href="mailto:shawndiego15@gmail.com">send me an email</a> with any questions, concerns, or inquiries.

My goal for this site is to publish programs and projects I create throughout my experience in the information technology field. Ultimately I would love to network and collaborate with others who have similair interests and goals.

### Currency Converter utilizing Classes in C#

{Soon to be Replaced}

For the time being, this will feature the most recent graded assignment in my visual programming class. The project is a currency converter that allows a user to enter a value in US dollars, select a currency, and retreive the converted value. The main content regarding this assignment is utilizing an outside class to perform all of the calculations. This was our first at-home assignment for the semester so it is a simple program that allows us to build upon as we develop our skills.

Personalized GUI for the currency converter:

Code for the currency converter class, retrieved from a seperate class library:

Code behind the currency converter form:

As you can see in the images above, all of the calculations are performed in the currency converter class. The code behind the form for the project simply calls upon the class to perform the calculations and retrieves the result. When the conversion button is clicked, the form retrieves the value from the textbox and parses it into a decimal data type. The conversion type is obtained from the listbox, and the values are sent into the currency converter class for calculation.

With this class being created, any programs in the future can have access to this conversion calculator. I am building my own personal class library as I progress, and will more than likely upload it when it contains more content.


### Basic Class Diagram for SQL Server

{Soon to be Replaced}

Featured below is a basic UML class diagram for a database designe based on a given prompt and business rules. Currently I do not have access to the entire prompt as this was from a previous semester, but in short the database revolves around a plane airline.

Once we have designed our class diagram we can move onto actual construction of the database in SQL server. I have my text file for this design featured here: [ConstructTable.txt](https://github.com/ShawnDominguezDEV/homepage/files/2453722/ConstructTable.txt)


For the last part of this assignment we were tasked with running various queries through our data. These queries written for SQL are listed here as well:
